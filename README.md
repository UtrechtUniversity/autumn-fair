# Autumn FAIR project 

This project is a follow up project of the SUMMER FAIR project (https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/summer-fair). 
Data sets on transmission experiments may vary in format, structure, syntax and semantics. It is difficult to combine these heterogeneous data sets, for example, to do reanalysis and meta-analysis. 
In this follow up project we present a data-standard based on an existing ontology (Infection Transmission Ontology) and an analysis pipeline with steps to interpret data, apply different estimation procedures including different underlying infectious disease dynamics (e.g. indirect versus direct transmission).
